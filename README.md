# Toronto Subway Delays Analysis ðŸš‡

The Toronto Transit Commission has published subway delay data to Toronto's open data portal which contains over 140K entries of delays and spans from January 2014 to June 2021. For this analysis, I looked specifically at all delays that occurred from 2017-2021. The SRT lines have their own unique transit commission and delay codes and therefore have also been omitted from this analysis. I wanted to explore which subway travel routes would have the least amount of delays and as well as the date and times best suited for travel.
